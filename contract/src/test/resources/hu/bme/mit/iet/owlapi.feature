Feature: Ontology operations

  Scenario: Load ontology
    Given Create a fresh ontology manager to handle ontologies
    When Load the http://home.mit.bme.hu/~fandrew/integralt/szepmuveszeti-dbpedia.2017-03-10.owl ontology
    Then Ontology has 1696 axioms
    And Ontology has 762 logical axioms
    And Ontology has Turtle format

  Scenario: Add and remove axiom
    Given Create a fresh ontology manager to handle ontologies
    When Load the http://home.mit.bme.hu/~fandrew/integralt/szepmuveszeti-dbpedia.2017-03-10.owl ontology
    And Add Agent as subclass to the Person class
    Then Ontology has 1697 axioms
    When Remove Agent as subclass from the Person class
    Then Ontology has 1696 axioms

  Scenario: Merge two ontology
    Given Create a fresh ontology manager to handle ontologies
    When Load the http://home.mit.bme.hu/~fandrew/integralt/szepmuveszeti-dbpedia.2017-03-10.owl ontology
    And Merge ontology with http://home.mit.bme.hu/~fandrew/iir/pc_shop.owl ontology
    Then Merged ontology has 1804 axioms

  Scenario Outline: Adding a new class with disjoint axiom then removing it
    Given Create a fresh ontology manager to handle ontologies
    When Load the http://home.mit.bme.hu/~fandrew/iir/pc_shop.owl ontology
    Then Ontology has 107 axioms
    And LCD class has 0 disjoint class
    When Add the "<newclass>" class as disjoint class with LCD class
    Then Ontology has 108 axioms
    And LCD class has 1 disjoint class
    When Remove the "<newclass>" class with its axioms as well
    Then Ontology has 107 axioms
    And LCD class has 0 disjoint class

    Examples:
      | newclass     |
      | Kat√≥dsugaras |
      | Led          |
      | Plazma       |
